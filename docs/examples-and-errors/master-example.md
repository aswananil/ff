# Master Example

'flutter_map' comes with an example application, available [on GitHub](https://github.com/fleaflet/flutter_map/tree/master/example).

To build and run this application clone the repository onto your local system, enter into the example directory, then build as normal (`flutter build ...`). When built, you can install onto a real device and experiment with the wide range of features available and see what's best for your app.
