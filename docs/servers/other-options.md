# Other Options

There are plenty of other tile servers you can choose from, free or paid. Most provide a static tile service/API, usually called Static Tiles or just Tile Requests (if no Vector tiles are supported). You aren't usually looking for Static Maps: these are different.

A good catalogue of servers (usually called Providers elsewhere) can be found at [Switch2OSM](https://switch2osm.github.io/providers/). Switch2OSM also provides detailed instructions on [how to host your own tiles](https://switch2osm.github.io/serving-tiles/): this can be surprisingly economical and enjoyable if you don't mind a few hours in a Linux console.
