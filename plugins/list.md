# Plugins List

There are many independently maintained 'plugins' created by the 'flutter\_map' community that give extra, prebuilt functionality, saving you even more time and potentially money.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Although these plugins have been checked by 'flutter\_map' maintainers, 'flutter\_map' maintainers do not accept responsibility for any issues or threats posed by independently maintained plugins.

Use plugins at your own risk.
{% endhint %}

Some pages in this documentation provide direct links to these plugins, where appropriate, to make it easier for you to find a suitable plugin: these are listed below as well. Other links in documentation may point to useful libraries, but not necessarily flutter\_map dedicated plugins: these are not listed below.

However, if you're just browsing, a list is provided below (in no particular order), containing many of the open-source plugins, each with a short description by the author saying what the plugin does/what it's useful for:
